Getting Started
-----------------------------------

Bootstrapping is a statistical technique developed by Bradley Efron (1979) that
creates measures of accuracy for almost any statistic. The purpose of resample
is to simplify the process and check whether the bootstrap is valid. 

Installation with git
===================================

resample is designed to be used alongside `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ but has to be installed seperately. Download
the git repository using the following command::
