Getting Started - What is reample
-----------------------------------
Resampling in statistics refers to any method that draws repeated samples from
the original dataset. This package intends to implement some of these methods;
the first of which is the bootstrap. 

Bootstrapping is a statistical technique developed by Bradley Efron (1979) that
creates measures of accuracy for almost any statistic. The purpose of resample
is to simplify the process and check whether the bootstrap is valid. 

Installation with git
===================================

resample is designed to be used alongside `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ but has to be installed seperately. Download
the git repository using the following command::
    
    git clone https://github.com/cenonn/resample.git

Go to the resample directory and enter::
    
    python setup.py install

After the install is complete, place the following line in any pyhon
environment to use resample::

    import resample as rs
