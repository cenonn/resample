Getting Started - What is resample
-----------------------------------
Resampling in statistics refers to any method that draws repeated samples from
the original dataset. This package intends to implement some of these methods;
the first of which is the bootstrap. 

Bootstrapping is a statistical technique developed by Bradley Efron (1979) that
creates measures of accuracy for almost any statistic. This becomes extremely
useful when a simple formula for the particular sample statistic or
distribution does not exist. 

Installation with git
===================================
resample is designed to be used alongside `Anaconda
<http://continuum.io/downloads>`_ but has to be installed seperately. Download
the git repository using the following command::
    
    git clone https://github.com/cenonn/resample.git

Go to the resample directory and enter::
    
    python setup.py install

After the install is complete, place the following line in any python
environment to use resample::

    import resample as rs
