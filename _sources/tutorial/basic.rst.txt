Throughout this tutorial, we will be using two datasets from Efron's book,
*An Introduction to the Bootstrap*. 

The first dataset, from Mardia, Kent, and
Biddy (1979), contains information  on 88 students who took examinations in 
five subjects. It is avavilable to download :download:`here <score.csv>`. The 
first five rows are below:

55  72  63  70  68

The second dataset contains information about the amount of an anti-inflammatory
hormone (mg) in 27 devices. It is available to download :download:`here
<hormone.csv>`. The first five rows are below:

boot()
===================================
The ``boot`` function encompasses the actual bootstrap algorithm and is the
fundamental piece of the package. **resample** implements the standard,
nonparametric version of the bootstrap. In order to perform a univariate 
bootstrap, a dataset and the estimator to be calculated are passed
into the function. In the below example, below we want to get a bootstrap
estimate of the variance of mechanics test scores ::

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import resample as rs
    
    bootstrap = rs.boot(score["mec"], np.var)

The ``boot`` function will then perform 10,000 boostrap simulations by 
default.  

A few things to note:

#. In a univariate scenario, the dataset passed into ``boot()`` needs to be
   either a ``np.array``, ``pd.Series``, or univariate ``pd.DataFrame``. 
#. The function passed can be any function, user-defined or otherwise. In the
   simple scenario above where we only have data in one dimension, it makes
   sense for this function to return one numeric value.

Results Objects
===================================
Results objects hold the results from all the boostrap simulations, the
estimator that was calculated, and the sample statistic. The primary use of
this object will usually be to calculate various properties about the estimate
such as the standard error ::

    bootstrap.se()

It can also be used to plot a histogram of the bootstrap distribution ::

    bootstrap.plot()

.. plot::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import resample as rs

    data = pd.read_csv("score.csv")
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data["mec"], np.var)
    bootstrap.plot()

One of the most important reasons to perform a bootstrap is to calculate an
actual estimate. Because the results are a distribution, the user needs decide
what would be an appropriate choice of center to use as a point estimate. The
mean and median are common choices for this ::

    bootstrap.point_estimate(np.mean)
    bootstrap.point_estimate(np.median)

Another advantage of using the bootstrap for estimation is that the calculation
of the bias of an estimator become trivial. With **resample**, the user can
either look at bias directly or apply a bias correction to their estimate ::
    
    bootstrap.bias()
    bootstrap.point_estimate(np.mean, correction=True)

Often, an interval estimate is better than a point estimate. Many different
bootstrap confidence intervals exist; **resample** allows the user to calculate
efron, percentile, or BCa intervals be specifying the ``kind`` argument ::

    bootstrap.ci(kind="efron")
    bootstrap.ci(kind="scale_percentile")
    bootstrap.ci(kind="BCa")
