Basic Tutorial
===================================
Throughout this tutorial, we will be using the score dataset from Mardia, Kent,
and Bibby (1979) on 88 students who took examinations in five subjects. It is
available to download :download:`here <score.csv>`. This is a dataset that 
Efron has used in his book, *An Introduction to the Bootstrap*::

    import numpy as np
    import pandas as pd
    import resample as rs

    data = pd.read_csv("score.csv")
    data.head()

boot()
-----------------------------------
The *boot* function encompasses the actual bootstrap algorithm and is the
fundamental piece of the package. resample implements the standard,
nonparametric version of the bootstrap. In order to perform a univariate 
bootstrap, a dataset and the estimator to be calculated are passed
into the function::
    
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data["mec"], np.var)

The *boot* function will then perform 10,000 boostrap simulations by 
default. This returns a **UnivariateResults** object.

A few things to note:

#. The dataset needs to be either a **numpy array**, **pandas Series**, or 
   **univariate pandas DataFrame**.
#. The function passed can be any function, user-defined or otherwise, as long
   as it returns a single value. 

UnivariateResults Objects
-----------------------------------
Results objects hold the results from all the boostrap simulations, the
estimator that was calculated, and the sample statistic. The primary use of
this object will usually be to calculate various properies about the estimate
such as the standard error::

    bootstrap.se()

It can also be used to plot a histogram of the bootstrap distribution::

    bootstrap.plot()

.. plot::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import resample as rs

    data = pd.read_csv("score.csv")
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data["mec"], np.var)
    bootstrap.plot()

These objects have more functionality beyond these two examples. See the 
:doc:`modules <../refs/modules>` for more information.
