===================================
resample provides other features when performing bootstraps, multivariate
bootstraps, user-defined estimators, and validity checks through Statistics
objects. 

Multivariate Bootstraps
-----------------------------------
Performing multivariate bootstraps with resample simply involves passing a
pandas dataframe with all the columns to bootstrap::

    multi_boostrap = rs.boot(data[["mec", "vec"]], np.mean)

This will return a MultivariateResults object. These objects function the same
way their univariate counterpart does; the only difference is that some of the
methods now have a 'col' argument to specify which column to look at::

    multi_bootstrap.plot(col=1)

.. plot::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import resample as rs

    data = pd.read_csv("score.csv")
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data[["mec", "vec"]], np.var)
    bootstrap.plot(col=1)

User-defined Estimators
-----------------------------------
All of the previous examples utilize numpy functions as their estimators.
Users can define their own functions to pass into boot(). This in conjunction
with multivariate datasets can be extremely powerful. *insert example with
regression*


Statistics Objects
-----------------------------------
Certain estimators will not be valid to bootstrap. This includes statistics
like the maximum and minimum. resample solves this problem by building up
estimators using Statistics objects. 

These objects contain commonly statistics and hold information on whether
they are valid or not. More complicated estimators can be created by
adding, subtracting, etc. with other estimators and numeric values.
