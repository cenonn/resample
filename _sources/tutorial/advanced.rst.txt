===================================
**resample** provides other features when performing bootstraps:
multivariate bootstraps and validity checks.

Multivariate Bootstraps
-----------------------------------
Performing multivariate bootstraps with **resample** involves passing a
**pandas** dataframe with all the columns to bootstrap into *boot*::

    multi_bootstrap = rs.boot(data[["mec", "vec"]], np.var)

This will return a **MultivariateResults** object. These objects function
the same way their univariate counterpart does; the only difference is 
that some of the methods now have a required *col* argument to specify 
which column to look at::

    multi_bootstrap.plot(col=1)

.. plot::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import resample as rs

    data = pd.read_csv("score.csv")
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data[["mec", "vec"]], np.var)
    bootstrap.plot(col=1)

Validity Checks using Statistics Objects
----------------------------------------
Certain estimators will not be valid to bootstrap. This includes statistics
like the maximum and minimum. resample solves this problem by building up
estimators using **Statistics** objects. 

These objects contain common statistics and hold information on whether
they are valid to bootstrap or not. More complicated estimators can be 
created by adding, subtracting, etc. with other estimators and numeric values.
After being created, they need to be passed into the *boot* function
inplace of a function.

If someone wanted to look at the average of the mean and median, they would
need to::

    estimator = (rs.Mean() + rs.Quantile(0.5)) / 2
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data["mec"], estimator)

This particular case uses a valid estimator, so resample will not give a
warning. 

Using the max on the otherhand would cause resample to give a warning::

    estimator = rs.Max()
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data["mec"], estimator)
    # this would raise a python warning

This feature can be completely bypassed if a user wants to proceed with the
bootstap anyway.
