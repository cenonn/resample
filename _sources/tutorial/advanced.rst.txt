===================================
resample provides other features when performing bootstraps: multivariate
bootstraps and validity checks.

Multivariate Bootstraps
-----------------------------------
Performing multivariate bootstraps with resample simply involves passing a
**pandas** dataframe with all the columns to bootstrap::

    multi_boostrap = rs.boot(data[["mec", "vec"]], np.mean)

This will return a MultivariateResults object. These objects function the same
way their univariate counterpart does; the only difference is that some of the
methods now have a *col* argument to specify which column to look at::

    multi_bootstrap.plot(col=1)

.. plot::

    import pandas as pd
    import numpy as np
    import resample as rs

    data = pd.read_csv("score.csv")
    bootstrap = rs.boot(data[["mec", "vec"]], np.var)
    bootstrap.plot(col=1)

Statistics Objects
-----------------------------------
Certain estimators will not be valid to bootstrap. This includes statistics
like the maximum and minimum. resample solves this problem by building up
estimators using Statistics objects. 

These objects contain commonly statistics and hold information on whether
they are valid or not. More complicated estimators can be created by
adding, subtracting, etc. with other estimators and numeric values.
