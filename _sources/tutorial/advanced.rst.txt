===================================
resample provides two other features when performing bootstraps, multivariate
bootstraps and validity checks through Statistics objects. 

Multivariate Bootstraps
-----------------------------------
Performing multivariate bootstraps with resample simply imvolves passing a
pandas dataframe with all the columns to bootstrap::

    multi_boostrap = rs.boot(data, np.mean) #insert line with making the df

This will return a MultivariateResults object. These objects function the same
way their univariate counterpart does; the only difference is that some of the
methods now have a 'col' argument to specify which column to look at::

    bootstrap.se(col=2)




Statistics Objects
-----------------------------------
Certain estimators will not be valid to bootstrap. This includes statistics
like the maximum and minimum. resample solves this problem by building up
estimators using Statistics objects. 

These objects match up to commonly found statistics and hold information 
on whether they are valid or not. More complicated estimators can be created by
adding, subtracting, etc with other estimators and numeric values.
